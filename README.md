# HAMMING-CODE

Successfully implemented Hamming code error correction on an Artix-7 FPGA board. This project involved using the FPGA's GPIO pins and LEDs to visualize the process. The LEDs were used to represent the data bits and the corresponding parity bits generated by the Hamming code algorithm. By lighting up LEDs to indicate the transmitted and corrected bits, I demonstrated the error-checking and correction capabilities of Hamming code in a hands-on manner. This practical project not only enhanced my understanding of error correction techniques but also showcased the real-time feedback provided by the FPGA board's LEDs
